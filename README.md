# SkinDetection - ML Model (Convolutional Neural Network)

The CNN model was developed using TensorFlow with a Transfer Learning approach, leveraging a pretrained model, EfficientNetV2, combined with fine-tuning techniques. These techniques included freezing specific layers, applying GlobalPooling, Dense layers, and BatchNormalization for optimization. The image dataset was collected through web scraping from various sources, including Kaggle, and augmented using advanced preprocessing. Specifically, we employed the efficientnetv2 preprocess function to normalize the images to match the requirements of the EfficientNetV2 architecture.
